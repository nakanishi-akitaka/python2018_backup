###Purpose
This is for everyone to have a taste of gcForest before Professor Zhou release their code.

###Some things you may want to know
Due to my computer's performance, I limited training set size and scaner size in the code.

I try to program MultiGrainedScaner and CascadeForest exactly the same way described in Professor Zhou's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835). But in fact, I used CV prediction (or OOB prediction) instead of averaged CV results.That may make some differences.

###Thanks
Thanks to Professor Zhou's deep forest model. It really performs excellently on small-scale data. Looking forward to its performance on large-scale data and future expansion.

Thanks to everyone who saw this code. I will be very honored if it can help you a little bit.
