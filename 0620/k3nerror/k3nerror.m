function k3nerror = k3nerror( X1, X2, k)
% k-nearest neighbor normalized error for visualization and reconstruction (k3nerror) ? a measure for data visualization performance
%
% k-nearest neighbor normalized error (k3n-error)
% When X1 is data of X-variables and X2 is data of Z-variables (low-dimensional data), this is k3n error in visualization (k3n-Z-error).
% When X1 is Z-variables (low-dimensional data) and X2 is data of data of X-variables, this is k3n error in reconstruction (k3n-X-error).
% k3n-error = k3n-Z-error + k3n-X-error

% --- input ---
% X1 : X-variables ( m x n, m is the number of samples and n is the number of variables) or Z-variables ( m x 2 )
% X2 : Z-variables or X-variables

% --- output ---
