# Introduction

*Inspired by https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835 and https://github.com/STO-OTZ/my_gcForest/*


[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835) introduces **gcForest** as an alternative to
Deep Learning techniques. Here's an initial implementation of what *I concluded* the *gcForest* algorithm is.

# To do

1. Scikit-learn wrapper

# Running the example

1. Create virtual environment: `python3.x -m venv env && source env/bin/activate`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Jupyter: `jupyter-notebook`
4. Open the `deep-forest-example` notebook
